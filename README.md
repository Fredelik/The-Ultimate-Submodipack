# Hey there
### [The Ultimate Submodipack](https://github.com/Lustuc/The-Ultimate-Submodipack/blob/main/THE%20ULTIMATE%20SUBMODIPACK.md) is a big list of good quality mods for Subnautica as well as instructions for people who are new to modding. Keeping it on GitHub allows me to update it easily without ever worrying about losing the file, and is more practical for sharing with people. Anyone is free to reccomend new mods they'd like to see in the list!
